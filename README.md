That is predicting the player's overall rating based on some features such as age, height, weight, player's position, performance and stats.


### Dataset
Two datasets are shown in this repository. The main dataset used for training is players_21.csv and the other, players_22.csv was used for testing.
In this dataset, our target/dependable variable was overall which signifies a player's overall rating.

### Training of model
Three machine learning models were used for the predictive analysis.
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Model Performance Evaluation
* Cross validation is used here to assess the performance of each model.
